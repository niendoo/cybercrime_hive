They navigate to the content editor to create new articles using the block-based editor, adding media from the library and optimizing for SEO. Content can be scheduled for future publication or saved as drafts. User management allows role assignment and monitoring of user activities. The reports center provides oversight of cybercrime cases with analytics and case management tools.

**Content Creator Workflow:**
Editors and authors log into the dashboard to view their content assignments and performance metrics. They use the advanced content editor to create rich, multimedia content with built-in SEO guidance. The media library provides tools for organizing and editing images and files. Content goes through an approval workflow before publication, with automated notifications to relevant stakeholders.

**Public User Workflow:**
Visitors browse the modern frontend to access knowledge base articles, submit cybercrime reports, and interact with content through comments and social sharing. The search functionality helps users find relevant information quickly. Registered users can track their submitted reports and receive updates on case progress.
